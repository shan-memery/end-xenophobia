          <h3>The Long</h3>
          <p>The global response to COVID-19 has made it clear that as the virus spread from China to other countries, anti-Asian sentiments and discrimination followed closely behind, resulting in the plummeting of Asian businesses, near-deserted Chinatown districts, and racial bullying and harassment of people of and not of Chinese descent. Our organization seeks to bring awareness and educate others on the impacts of COVID-19 on Asian communities as well as the prevalence of xenophobia against Asians as a whole.</p>

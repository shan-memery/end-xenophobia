            And then leads to discriminatory public health policies that disproportionately impact 
            specific immigrant groups and minority groups.”

          <b>Interview Highlights on Asian American Discrimination</b>
          <br> <br>
          <b>George Takei:</b> <br>
          “Asian Americans are Americans. Certain segments of the Asian American
           community have been here since the 1840s. We are many generations here. We are Americans.
            And as a matter of fact, Asian Americans are a part of the front line doctors, nurses,
             researchers looking for a cure. We are a part of America. And still we are seen in the
              context of our ancestral land. My grandparents came from Japan.
          <br><br>
          "In the case of many of my Chinese American friends, it's their great-great-grandparents
           that came from China. We are Americans. And still we are compared in the context of our
            ancestral land. Yes, there are a lot of first generation and second generation Asian Americans,
             but it's the same as with our German or Italian or Irish friends. They have been here a long
              time and they are part of America, despite the fact that we still have immigration ... immigrants
               coming from Germany or Italy or Ireland.”

          <br><br>
          <b>Cathy Park Hong:</b>
          <br>
           “It's a really scary and vulnerable time for Asian Americans, that
           they are being scapegoated. Anyone who looks East Asian. And what I want to say is
            I would say, allow yourself to be scared, but also allow yourself to be angry. I
             think some of us — I wouldn't say all of us — some of us are activists, but some
              of us are afraid to even be angry. And be enraged. And I'm hoping that we speak
               out about this hate as much as possible and that we could be proactive about this
                and we could fight the racism in this country.
